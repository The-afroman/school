DESCRIPTION: 
    perform a DFS starting at Chicago (always choose the edge with the smallest mileage).   
    Identify the discovery edges and the back edges. What is the total distance travelled 
    on the discovery edges? Use an Adjacency List structure. Output the Adjacency List. 
                                
                                THEN

    perform a BFS starting at Chicago (always choose the edge with the smallest mileage).  
    Identify the discovery edges and the cross edges. What is the total distance travelled
    on the discovery edges? Use an Adjacency Matrix structure.  Output the Adjacency Matrix.
