1.  STL is the standard template library in c++ and a vector is one template in 
    the c++ STL which store data similar to array but are dynamic and can change
    in size

2.  resize, reserve, shrink_to_fit, push_back

3.  the STL array is a container which encapsulates fixed size arrays, unlike     
    c-style arrays agregate assignment can be used on STL arrays

4.  reserve() changes capacity, capacity is not the same as size, extra capacity 
    is used so that the array does not need to grow after every item is added.

5.  movers the iterator to the begining or end of vector

6.  // create vector of all spots
    for (int i = 0; i < spaces; i++)
        lotoVector.push_back(i+1);
